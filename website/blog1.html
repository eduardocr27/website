          <h2>In Persuit of Honor</h2>
          <div class="article-info">By Eduardo Cárdenas <time datetime="2021-02-11">at February 11, 2021</time></div>

            <p>This has been a rough year for the entire world, I am thankful the only thing my family and I have faced is boredom and not a really contagious and killer virus or even worst, unemployment. In this boredom is where this website was conceived, my ability to procrastinate has been increasing with the pandemic, but I knew I had to do something with this spare time apart from school. Having your own place on the internet feels great and somehow surreal, I think everyone should have their own website no matter the age. This first entry is going to be short and concise since I don't have much to say other than there is for sure so much to do here, and I would love for you, whoever you are, to stick around and see this “tree” grow to its fullest height.</p>
              
            <p>'Til that time.
              </p>
              <p>Safe journeys and the best of luck.</p>
