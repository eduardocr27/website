No, but for real, here you will find the things that I love, and have my approval (like if you need it).

            <h3>Music for the Masses</h3>

            <p>When it comes to music, I generally tend to stay away from mainstream music, don't get me wrong on few occasions I will listen to few of those and I will like them, but in my opinion, mainstream music has been downhill since the popularization of genres like reggaeton that is constantly repeating the same beat across multiple songs and really is somewhat vulgar and intense lyrics. However I do like rap. </p>
          
<p>Something worth pointing out is that I don't often listen to music in my mother tongue that is spanish, not necessarily because I dislike latin american music (mostly) I do have exceptions that reach my top all time favorite songs.</p>

<p>But I will let you judge me, please listen to my playlist that I will link and be sure to follow me on Spotify :)</p>

              The only playlist that matters <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LiF42c7rpw2vNmPv40BRC">here</a>

            <h3>Software</h3>


            <p>I'm about getting things done quickly and having as little space between my thoughts and actions on the computer. Here are the programs I use for most of my work. I'm only putting here programs I consider tried and true and have used for a while.</p>
